shadow-20001016 => shadow-4.0.0

- fix bug discovered and fixed by Marcel Ritter
  <Marcel.Ritter@rrze.uni-erlangen.de>
  Due to a big buffer size in lib/commonio.c this error does only appear
  if a line gets longer than 4096 bytes (there are probably very few people
  stumbling across this).
  Ths bug can be exposed by trashing /etc/groups file with using useradd
  with script:
	#!/bin/sh
	typeset -i NUM
	NUM=0
	groupadd demogroup
	while [ $NUM -le 1000 ]; do
	   useradd -g demogroup -G demogroup -p "NONE" user$NUM
	   NUM=$NUM+1
	done
- remove limit 32 to groups per user by (the same user can belong to
  more than 32 groups) by use sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) instead constant
  NGROUPS_MAX (patch by Radu Constantin Rendec <radu.rendec@ines.ro>)
  NOTE: it probably need testing on other system for add
  some condition for using sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) or NGROUPS_MAX constant,
- added -s option to {pw,grp}ck to sort checked files by UID/GID,
- drop detecting is pam_strerror() need one or two arguments. Instead using
  PAM_STRERROR() macro use directly pam_strerror() function with two
  arguments. pam_strerror() with one argument is obsoleted,
- adde ja man pages (probably some man pages need update),
- much better automake support,
- added pt_BR man pages for gpasswd(1), groupadd(8), groupdel(8),
  groupmod(8), shadow(5) (man pages for other nations also are welcome),
- mamny small fixes and updates nad improvements in man pages,
- aplayed Debian patch to man pages for shadowconfig,
- remove limit to 6 chars logged tty name (012_libmisc_sulog.c.diff Debian
  patch).

shadow-20001012 -> shadow-20001016:
- conditionaly disabled body reload_nscd() because not every
  version of nscd can handle it (this can be enabled by define
  ENABLE_NSCD_SIGHUP) (Marek Micha³kiewicz  <marekm@linux.org.pl>)
- fixes on autoconf/automake level for dist target,
- Julianne F. Haugh new contact adress.

shadow-20000902 => shadow-20001012

- removed /redhat directory with obsoleted files (partialy rewrited spec
  file is now in root directory),
- aplayed shadow-19990827-group.patch patch from RH wich prevents adduser
  overwrite previously existing groups in adduser,
- added PAM support for chage (bind to "chage" PAM config file) also
  added PAM support for all other small tools like chpasswd, groupadd,
  groupdel, groupmod, newusers, useradd, userdel, usermod (bind to common 
  "shadow" PAM config file) - this modificaytions mainly based on
  modifications prepared by Janek Rêkojarski <baggins@pld.org.pl>,
- many small fixes and improvments in automake (mow "make dist"
  works correctly),
- added cs translation (Jiri Pavlovsky <Jiri.Pavlovsky@ff.cuni.cz>).

shadow-20000826 => shadow-20000902

This is probably the last release from me.
Tomasz Kloczko <kloczek@rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl> is the new maintainer.
Good luck!

(I'm still interested to know what is going on with this package,
which is fairly important to many Linux distributions, so please
Cc: marekm@linux.org.pl in any related discussions - just don't
expect me to respond quickly...)

Previous warning still applies - be careful!

- applied some of the Red Hat patches (revised slightly), thanks to
  Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>: fix for truncated long
  lines (>8K) in /etc/group, send SIGHUP to nscd (caching daemon
  in glibc 2.1.x) after changing anything, add usermod -L and -U
  options, remove LOG_CONS from openlog(), chage -d and -E handles
  dates in yyyy-mm-dd format ('/' is not required)
- various cleanups

shadow-19990827 => shadow-20000826

WARNING: this release is not tested (other than that it compiles for me),
please be careful.  Previous release was a year ago, so it is really time
to release something and start looking for a new, better maintainer...
(I've been extremely busy recently.  Credit for most of the real work,
such as complete PAM support, should go to Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
who maintains this package for Debian.)

- merged most of the changes from Debian (not all of them yet, PAM support
  should be complete but is not tested - need to upgrade to potato first)
- added Polish translations of manual pages from PLD
- change sulog() to not depend on global variables oldname, name
- try to not follow symbolic links when deleting files recursively
  in userdel (still not perfect, safest to do it in single user mode)
- removed workarounds for ancient (pre-ANSI) C compilers - use gcc!
  (a few ANSI C constructs were used already, and no one complained)
- updated author's e-mail address (jfh@bga.com -> jfh@austin.ibm.com)

shadow-19990709 => shadow-19990827

- upgrade to autoconf-2.13, automake-1.4, libtool-1.3.3
- i18n: added French translation by Vincent Renardias <vincent@ldsol.com>
- i18n: added Swedish translation by Kristoffer Brånemyr <ztion@swipnet.se>
- logoutd no longer reads /etc/logoutd.mesg at startup - instead, read
  it when sending to luser's tty (no need to reload with SIGHUP)
- added support for "usergroups" feature often found in Linux distributions
  (if USERGROUPS_ENAB in login.defs set to "yes", uid != 0, uid == gid, and
  username == groupname, then set umask to 002 instead of 022)
- Debian: pwck and grpck are now run from a daily cron job (root will
  receive an e-mail if something is wrong), and at system startup
- added support for setting umask in /etc/limits
- when using OPIE, re-prompt with echo on after empty password was entered
- GETPASS_ASTERISKS now run time configurable (login.defs)
- getpass() now uses stdin and stderr (not stdout) if it can't open /dev/tty
- getpass() allows all input to be erased using Control-U, and beeps when
  too many characters are entered
- removed obsolete sgtty support, in 1999 everyone should have termios :)
- Debian: tar wrapper no longer needed to build packages as non-root user
  (install libtricks, and use "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" instead)
- Debian: changes for GNU Hurd by Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>:
  dpkg-architecture, cross compilation, only build passwd, add
  etc/login.defs.hurd conffile, conditionalize CBAUD
- newgrp sets $HOME before running the new shell
- both "sg group command" (usage message) and "sg group -c command"
  (man page) work, updated both the usage message and the man page :)
- i18n: added missing _() for some translatable strings

shadow-19990607 => shadow-19990709

- added PAM support to chfn and chsh (thanks to Thorsten Kukuk)
- fixed a bug in newgrp if the user is in >= 17 groups
- added @LIBSKEY@ to LDADD for all programs (for some reason,
  almost all programs need it if skey/opie support is enabled)
- changed grpconv/grpunconv to compile with --disable-shadowgrp
- changed faillog to do something (assume -p) with no options specified
- updated version of the udbachk passwd/shadow/group file integrity
  checker (contrib/udbachk.v012.tgz)

shadow-19990307 => shadow-19990607

- upgraded to libtool-1.2, latest config.{guess,sub}
- added missing #include "defines.h" in libmisc/login_desrpc.c - thanks
  to almost everyone for reporting it :-)
- moved PAM-related defines to pam_defs.h
- added some braces to if/else to avoid egcs warnings
- started adding PAM support to login (based on util-linux, not finished yet)
- changed "!" to "x" for pw_passwd in src/newusers.c
- a few more Y2K fixes
- added contrib/udbachk.tgz (passwd/shadow/group file integrity checker),
  thanks to Sami Kerola
- Debian: made /etc/{limits,login.access,login.defs,porttime,securetty}
  files all mode 0600 (Bug#38729 - login: /etc/limits is world readable)
- updated mailing list information (moved again, now hosted by SuSE),
  updated README.mirrors, other minor documentation updates
- made getpass work with redirected stdin
- new readpass echoing asterisks disabled by default by popular demand
  (can be enabled at compile time: ./configure --enable-readpass)
- the random number of asterisks in readpass is now more random
  (random number generator initialization was missing)
- commented out --enable-md5crypt (obsolete) in configure.in
- when checking for libskey, link with -lcrypt if libcrypt is available
  (otherwise the configure test for libskey fails - libskey needs libcrypt)
- added Package/Version ident strings (so you can use the RCS "ident"
  command to check any binary, which version of shadow it comes from)

shadow-981228 => shadow-19990307

- added support for setting process priority in /etc/limits
- i18n: updated Greek translation

- added restart/reload/force-reload to /etc/init.d/logoutd (found by lintian)
- always require password for root logins (even with NO_PASSWORD_CONSOLE)
- workaround for RedHat's CREATE_HOME feature in /etc/login.defs
- changed to Y2K compatible version numbering
- more Y2K fixes, use the ISO 8601 date format (yyyy-mm-dd) for default
  values of user-entered dates (you can still enter dates in any format
  supported by GNU date)
- oops, added doc/README.nls to list of files to distribute
- added missing sanitize_env() call to src/login.c
- debian/rules installs /bin/login non-setuid by default, just in case...
- build Debian packages with cracklib support (depends on cracklib-runtime)

shadow-980724 => shadow-981228

- login now clears the username in argv[] (in case someone types the
  password instead of username, by mistake)
- i18n support, Greek translation (Nikos Mavroyanopoulos), see README.nls
- updated author's e-mail address (jfh@tab.com -> jfh@bga.com)
- new getpass() replacement that displays *'s (Pavel Machek)
- no password required when logging in from ttys listed under
  NO_PASSWORD_CONSOLE in login.defs (Pavel Machek)
- fixed limits code so RLIMIT_AS should work
- upgraded to Debian 2.0
- built a new machine (P2 350MHz, 64MB RAM) so the thing can be compiled
  in reasonable time again
- upgraded to automake-1.3, libtool-1.0h (also new config.guess and
  config.sub that work on i686)
- usermod fixed to handle group names starting with digits (not recommended)

shadow-980626 => shadow-980724

- security: login no longer gives you a root shell if setgid()
  or initgroups() or setuid() fails for any reason, discovered
  by Ted Hickman <thickman@sy.net>
- remove libshadow.so -> libshadow.so.x.x symlink after install
- a few int -> uid_t type cleanups
- fail immediately (don't retry) in *_lock() if euid != 0
- added sample PAM config files etc/pam.d/{passwd,su}
- preliminary PAM support in su (untested - use at your own risk,
  comments and patches welcome!)
- cleanup and more comments in OPIE code (Algis Rudys)
- added support for TCFS (Transparent Cryptographic File System)
  (use ./configure --with-libtcfs, see http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/
  for more info), thanks to Aniello Del Sorbo

shadow-980529 => shadow-980626

- fixed bug in commonio_lock() (infinite recursion if lckpwdf() not
  used and database cannot be locked), thanks to Jonathan Hankins
- fixed bug in copy_tree() (NUL-terminate readlink() results),
  thanks to Lutz Schwalowsky
- no need to press Enter after Ctrl-C to interrupt password prompt
- removed a few harmless gcc warnings
- secure RPC login disabled if <rpc/key_prot.h> not found (glibc 2.0)
- faillog.8: changed /usr/adm -> /var/log
- pwconv.8: documented that it may fail on invalid password files

shadow-980417 => shadow-980529

- fixed "interesting" strzero() bug introduced by me in 980417:
  strzero(cp) didn't work as intended (the macro used a local
  variable called "cp" - oops...); Leonard N. Zubkoff was the
  first person to report it - thanks!
- fixed usermod -e to accept empty argument (like useradd),
  thanks to Martin Bene
- several changes from Debian 980403-0.2, see debian/changelog
- added contrib/shadow-anonftp.patch (not yet merged, sorry...)
  thanks to Calle Karlsson

shadow-980403 => shadow-980417

- fixed login session limits (again - broken since 980130)
- more symbolic constants for exit status values
- fixed logoutd to work with 8-character usernames in utmp
  (no room for terminating NUL!)
- various fixes to make the code more glibc2-friendly
- updated doc/cracklib26.diff (fix for empty gecos, etc.)
- updated the files in redhat/ from shadow-utils-970616-11.src.rpm
  (RH 5.0 updates)

shadow-980130 => shadow-980403

- security: su now creates the sulog file (if enabled and doesn't
  already exist) with umask 077
- hopefully removed arbitrary group size limits (not yet for
  shadow groups though - sgetsgent() still needs a rewrite,
  but I don't want to delay this release any longer...)
- fixed NULL dereference in groupmod -n

shadow-971215 => shadow-980130

- Debian binary packages can be built without root privileges
  (tar wrapper - debian/tar.c)
- new subdir "redhat" (needs more work, see redhat/README)
- in several places, exit(127) if exec fails with ENOENT, and
  exit(126) on other errors (as in ksh and bash)
- renamed getpass() and md5_crypt() to libshadow_* to avoid name
  conflicts with libc functions - md5_crypt() is also in libcrypt.a
  on Linux/PPC, thanks to Anton Gluck <gluc@midway.uchicago.edu>
- handle crypt() returning NULL (possible according to Single Unix
  Spec) more gracefully (exit instead of SIGSEGV)
- fixed bug in putgrent() that showed up when realloc() moved the
  buffer while expanding it, thanks to Floody <flood@evcom.net>
- fixed bug in login session limits (with a limit set to N logins,
  only N-1 logins were allowed), thanks to Floody <flood@evcom.net>
- upgraded to libtool-1.0h (now recognizes GNU ld on Debian 1.3.1)
- newer config.guess and config.sub (should work on x86 for x > 5)
- removed doc/automake-1.0.diff (obsoleted by automake-1.2)
- added doc/cracklib26.diff (some patches for cracklib-2.6)
- documented more (not all yet) login.defs(5) settings
- replaced more exit status numeric values with #defines
- shadow-utils.spec now generated from shadow-utils.spec.in
  (so I don't have to edit version numbers for every new release)
- groupadd -f option, based on RedHat's shadow-utils-970616-9 patch
  ("force" - exit(0) if the group already exists); other RedHat-
  specific options not added yet (best done in a perl script that
  runs useradd/usermod/groupadd - see Debian's adduser-3.x)
- added -O option (override login.defs values) to useradd and groupadd
- if usermod can't update the group file(s), exit(10) but update the
  password file(s) anyway (as documented by Solaris man page)
- useradd should no longer set sp_expire to the current date (oops)
- configure.in: added --enable-desrpc, check for gethostbyname in libc
  before trying libnsl (necessary for Solaris; not for Linux or Irix,
  even though libnsl may be present), fixed pw_age/pw_comment/pw_quota
  detection, setpgrp vs. setpgid, other minor tweaks
- various */Makefile.am tweaks
- login.defs: added FAKE_SHELL - program to run instead of the login
  shell, with the real shell in argv[0] (Frank Denis)
- login.defs: ignore case in yes/no settings
- more E_* defines instead of hardcoded numbers for exit()
- added sanitize_env() for setuid programs
- login_desrpc() checks for getnetname() errors
- new password is not "too similar" if it is long enough
- replacement strstr() was static, no one noticed :-)
- {pw,spw}_lock() and {pw,spw}_unlock() track the lock count and call
  lckpwdf() and ulckpwdf() as needed, *_lock_first() hack removed
- login sets $REMOTEHOST for remote logins
- added newgrp -l option (Single Unix Spec, same as "-")
- EXPERIMENTAL shared lib support using libtool (libshadow.so saves about
  200K of disk space on Linux/x86), enabled by default if supported by
  the system, use ./configure --disable-shared if it causes any problems.
  Warning: libshadow.so is intended for internal use by this package
  only - binary compatibility with future releases is not guaranteed.
  There should be no need to link any other programs with libshadow.so -
  the libshadow.so -> libshadow.so.x.x symlink is unnecessary.
- pam_strerror() takes one or two arguments, depending on the Linux-PAM
  version (!) - added check to configure; fixed do_pam_passwd prototype
- libmisc/login_access.c should compile on Linux/PPC and Solaris
- added information about the new ftp site to doc/README.mirrors

shadow-971001 => shadow-971215

- added workaround for NYS libc 5.3.12 (RedHat 4.2) bug to grpck
- updated the RPM .spec file
- renamed rlogin() to do_rlogin() to avoid Linux/PPC build problem
  (glibc defines something else named "rlogin" in utmpbits.h ?)
- added MD5 checksums in Debian packages
- added -p and -g options to vipw (edit the password or group file
  respectively, regardless of the command name in argv[0])
- removed old DBM support (NDBM code is still there)
- fixed a bug in gpasswd: current username was incorrectly identified as
  "root" because of setuid(0) done too early.  It may be a security hole
  when using shadow groups - if "root" is listed as a group administrator,
  any user can add/remove members in that group.  Thanks to Jesse Thilo.
- gpasswd now logs which user (root or group admin) made the changes
- passwd now uses $PATH to search for the chfn, chsh, gpasswd commands
- newgrp and add_groups() allocate supplementary group lists dynamically
- moved check_shell() from src/chsh.c to libmisc/chkshell.c
- CHFN_RESTRICT in login.defs can now specify exactly which fields may be
  changed by regular users (any combination of letters "frwh")
- fixed contrib/pwdauth.c segfault with non-existent usernames
- minor change in lib/getdef.c to handle quotes better (Juergen Heinzl)
- new date parsing code (from GNU date) used by useradd, usermod, chage
- upgraded to automake-1.2, added libtool-0.7 (no libshadow.so yet)
- converted code to ANSI C, added ansi2knr (untested - use gcc!)
- fixed useradd -G segfault (one '*' that shouldn't be there)
- allow 8-bit characters in chfn
- added support for RLIMIT_AS (max address space) in libmisc/limits.c
- changed the handling of NIS plus entries in password files
- some more tweaking in various debian/* files
- logoutd uses getutent() instead of reading utmp file directly
- fixed lckpwdf() called twice (and failing) when changing password
  if the user is not listed in /etc/shadow (Mike Pakovic)
- erase and kill characters left unchanged if not defined in login.defs

shadow-970616 => shadow-971001

- Debian: mkpasswd no longer installed (dbm files not supported)
- chpasswd checks for shadow/non-shadow at run time, too
- added chpasswd -e (input file with encrypted passwords) - Jay Soffian
- changed libmisc/login_access.c as suggested by Dave Hagewood
- replaced sprintf() with snprintf() in several places
- added lib/snprintf.[ch] (from XFree86) for systems without snprintf()
- minor tweaks in contrib/adduser.c (/usr/local -> /usr)
- non-root users can only run su with a terminal on stdin
- temporarily disabled DES_RPC because getsecretkey() causes login to hang
  for 5 minutes on at least one RH 4.0 system.  Not sure if this is a bug
  in libc, or system misconfiguration.  Needs further investigation.
- check for strerror() and -lrpcsvc (should compile on SunOS again)
- fixed free() called twice in libmisc/mail.c
- added information about mirror sites (doc/README.mirrors)
- updated pwconv.8 and pwunconv.8 man pages
- "make install" now installs pwconv, pwunconv, grpconv, grpunconv
- pwauth.8 no longer installed (AUTH_METHODS not supported by default)
- corrected su.1 man page ($SHELL not used)
- no need for --with-md5crypt if the MD5-based crypt() is already in libc
  (or another library specified in /etc/ld.so.preload - Linux ld.so 1.8.0+)
- cleaned up PASS_MAX in getpass() (127 always assumed)
- default editor for vipw changed from /bin/ae to a real editor :)

shadow-970601 => shadow-970616

- fixed execlp call (missing NULL) in src/vipw.c
- vipw now preserves permissions on edited files
- commented out the xdm-shadow hack in shadowconfig
- improved RedHat spec file (Timo Karjalainen)
- updated mailing list information
- added information about the shadow paper (doc/README.shadow-paper)
- renamed doc/console.c.spec (confused RPM)

  if MAIL_CHECK_ENAB=yes (sorry!)
- patches for OPIE support (Algis Rudys) (untested)
- programs that modify /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow will use
  lckpwdf() if available
- now compiles with PAM support! (still untested)
- cosmetic error message changes (prefixed by argv[0]:)

shadow-970216 => shadow-970502-2

- shadow group support fixes (grpconv didn't work - for some
  reason, putsgent() returns 1 instead of 0 on success;
  now -1 = failure, anything else = success)
- upgraded to autoconf-2.12
- pwconv and pwunconv now follow other UN*X systems and SVID3
  (modify files in place), original versions moved to "old"
- scologin.c moved to "old" (it was only for SCO Xenix) so
  people stop sending patches for scologin.c gcc warnings :)
- don't use the MD5* functions in libmisc/salt.c (glibc has
  the new md5 crypt(), but no <md5.h> and MD5* functions!)
- support for MkLinux, Solaris, JIS, Qmail (Frank Denis)
- "passwd -S -a" now really works
- support for Debian, vipw, a few fixes (Guy Maor)

- ISSUE_FILE_ENAB -> ISSUE_FILE in the sample /etc/login.defs
- fixes for glibc and DES_RPC (Thorsten Kukuk)
- limits.5 man page (Luca Berra)
- expiry will work setgid shadow too, removed euid 0 check
- added check for a64l() to configure (glibc)

shadow-961025 => shadow-970216

- major rewrite of *io.c (no more 4 copies of almost identical code)
- use fsync() (if available) instead of sync() when updating password files
- use fchmod() and fchown() if available
- keep the NIS "plus on a line by itself" entries at end of passwd/group
- configure checks location of passwd/chfn/chsh programs (/usr/bin or /bin)
- passwd -S -a: list information about all users (root only)
- passwd -k: change only expired passwords
- passwd -q: quiet mode
- first attempt at PAM support in passwd
- passwd updates the non-shadow password if /etc/shadow exists but the
  user has no shadow password
- passwd logs who changed the password, added hook to allow non-root
  administrators who can change passwords (not implemented yet)
- su sets $HOME even without the "-" option (suggested by Joey Hess)
- added -p (set encrypted password) option to useradd and usermod
  (idea from hpux10 - undocumented option used internally by SAM)
- useradd -D -e does the right thing (set default expiration date)
- USERDEL_CMD in login.defs instead of hardcoded {ATRM,CRONTAB}_COMMAND
  because there are just too many systems that need different commands
- removed #ifdef FAILLOG_LOCKTIME (now always enabled), warning: the
  faillog file format has been changed (somewhere between 960129 and
  960810), please truncate the old file (if any) to zero length
- ISSUE_FILE (may be different from /etc/issue) instead of ISSUE_FILE_ENAB
- wtmp, lastlog, faillog file location guessed by configure
- separate checks for invalid user and group names, max username length
  based on struct utmp (it's not always 8 characters)
- pwck and grpck now check for invalid user/group names
- pwck -q (quiet, report only serious problems) option added
- separate cleaner sgetpwent() without the NIS magic
- NIS entries ignored (never changed) by *io.c, pwck, grpck
- various code cleanups
- new get_my_pwent() function for getting my own username, uid etc.
- faillog opens the file read-write if possible (even if not root)
- passwd -S allowed for normal users (for their own uid only)
- handle the case of login denied to passwordless accounts better
  ("Login incorrect" without "Password:" prompt looks strange)
- corrected author information and removed a copyright restriction

shadow-960925 => shadow-961025

- fixed a few typos in shadow group code
- don't check for names starting with 'r' to determine if the shell
  is restricted, use /etc/shells instead (for the "rc" shell)
- removed extra definition of LASTLOG_FILE in configure.in
- expiry no longer segfaults if no /etc/shadow
- userdel -r "can't remove mailbox" warning no longer printed on success

- use hardcoded names instead of basename(argv[0]) for openlog() in programs
  that users can run (chage, chfn, chsh, gpasswd, login, newgrp, passwd, su)
- small fix to isexpired(), and use it in passwd as well
- use strftime() and strptime() if available
- added chmod 600 /etc/passwd- at the end of pwconv5 (backup file may
  contain encrypted passwords!)
- pass size to change_field (chage, chfn, chsh) instead of assuming BUFSIZ
  (nothing bad happened yet, just a cleanup)
- gpasswd should work with both shadow and non-shadow group passwords
- detect unsupported options if no shadow (gpasswd, useradd, usermod)
- passwd -e for sunos4 (ATT_AGE), untested
- read environment from file (ENVIRON_FILE in login.defs), idea from ssh
- small fix to l64a()
- passwd prints a message after password successfully changed (for things
  like poppassd which run passwd and expect some output)
- passwd logs if password was changed by root (as opposed to a luser)
- passwd uses current uid if no username argument and getlogin() fails

shadow-960910 => shadow-960920

- use malloc for environment variables, no more MAXENV (Juergen Heinzl)
- newusers should work with both shadow and non-shadow passwords
  (still left to do: chpasswd, gpasswd)
- login-static no longer compiled by default
- more SYSLOG() macros

shadow-960810 => shadow-960910

- updated README.linux to point to the new ftp site
- chfn and chsh optionally (CHFN_AUTH) prompt for password like util-linux
- man pages now closer to LDP standards (Ivan Nejgebauer)
- newgrp uses SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (not SU) as in the /etc/login.defs comments

- login reports invalid login time, not "Login incorrect" (Ivan Nejgebauer)
- logoutd sets OPOST before writing to the tty (Ivan Nejgebauer)
- sulogin: don't use syslog(), other minor changes (Ivan Nejgebauer)
- passwords can be changed if sp_max == -1 (now considered infinity)
- usermod: don't use sizeof(struct lastlog) when writing to faillog (ugh)
- started replacing lots of #ifdef USE_SYSLOG with cleaner macros
- contrib/rpasswd.c added (Joshua Cowan)
- PASS_MAX is 127 with MD5_CRYPT (not just for Linux - sunos4 too...)
- workarounds for a RedHat NYS libc getspnam() bug (if /etc/shadow
  doesn't exist, it succeeds and returns sp_lstchg==0 instead of -1).

shadow-960129 => shadow-960810

- automake, configure checks for libcrypt and libcrack (Janos Farkas)
- added --enable-shadowgrp to configure (shadow groups disabled by default)
- should compile on SunOS 4.1.x - but it does NOT mean that it works :-)
- login sets HUSHLOGIN=TRUE or FALSE (for shell startup scripts etc.)
- hopefully removed all the rcsid warnings
- contrib/atudel perl script to remove at jobs (thanks to Brian Gaeke)
- resource limits (Cristian Gafton)
- workaround for buggy init/getty(?) leaving junk in ut_host on RedHat
- more fixes in man pages
- pwck and grpck no longer suggest to run mkpasswd if *DBM not compiled in
- most programs (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, grpck, login, passwd, pwck,
  su, useradd, userdel, usermod) should now work with both shadow and
  non-shadow passwords/groups (check for /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow at
  run time); a few programs still left to do
- mailbox mv/chown/rm in usermod/userdel (suggested by Cristian Gafton)
- new contrib/adduser.c from Chris Evans
- lots of other minor changes
- source tree reorganization, GNU autoconf, portability cleanups
- basename() renamed to Basename() to avoid name space confusion
- new programs to create /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow: pwconv5, grpconv
- newgrp cleanup and a few fixes
- useradd uses PASS_MAX_DAYS, PASS_MIN_DAYS and PASS_WARN_AGE
- don't make the first group member the group admin by default
  (define FIRST_MEMBER_IS_ADMIN to get the old gpasswd behaviour)
- password aging constants, NGROUPS_MAX and syslog stuff in only one
  place (defines.h) instead of repeating it in all source files...
- added userdel -r safety check (refuse to remove the home directory
  if it would result in removing some other user's home directory)
- usermod -u now correctly checks for non-unique uid (unless -o)
- sync() after updating password files, just to be more safe
- "make install" should install /etc/login.defs if it doesn't exist
- new option to control what happens if we can't cd to the home directory
  (DEFAULT_HOME in /etc/login.defs)
- enter the home directory as the user, not as root (for NFS etc.)
- added check for Slackware bugs (nobody UID -1) in pwck and grpck
- new CONSOLE_GROUPS feature (thanks to pacman@tardis.mars.net), it is
  possible to add specified groups (floppy etc.) for console logins
- new faillog feature: lock account for specified (per-user) time since
  the last failure after exceeding the failure limit
- new man pages (gpasswd.1, login.access.5, suauth.5)
- fixes in man pages, renamed *.4 to *.5
- new "contrib" directory (two adduser programs)
- changed some "system" to "feature" #ifdefs (autoconf someday...)
- sulogin no longer requires to be run from init, should work from rc
  scripts too
- changes to prevent unshadowing with libc SHADOW_COMPAT (get info
  using xx_locate(), modify it and call xx_update(), don't write back
  anything returned by getpwnam() etc.)
- stupid bug fixed in lastlog.c
- don't move non-directories in "usermod -m"
- don't log unknown usernames (passwords mistyped for usernames) (lmain.c)
- macros to get around ancient compilers which don't like prototypes
- make more use of "const" (not everywhere yet)
- added #ifdef AUTH_METHODS - very few people use administrator defined
  authentication methods because many programs are not aware of them;
  not supporting them makes the code simpler
- new "save" and "restore" Makefile targets, thanks to Rafal Maszkowski
- sgetgrent() in libshadow.a is optional, some versions of libc have it,
  see HAVE_SGETGRENT in config.h (grent.c)
- don't use continued lines in /etc/group, the standard getgr*() functions
  don't support that (grent.c)
- removed the third main() argument (according to libc docs, not allowed by
  POSIX.1 - use environ instead) (lmain.c, smain.c, newgrp.c, sulogin.c)
- login access control (lmain.c, login_access.c)
- added copyright notice to login_access.c (from logdaemon-5.0)
- detailed su access control (smain.c, suauth.c) - thanks to Chris Evans
- added closelog() in su before executing the shell (smain.c)
- getting current user name changed (smain.c)
- "x" instead of "*" in pw_passwd, consistent with pwconv (useradd.c)
- getpass() shouldn't return NULL except on errors (getpass.c)
- moved isexpired() to isexpired.c (now part of libshadow.a) from age.c
- SunOS4-like passwd -e (force change on next login) (isexpired.c, passwd.c)
- can use shadow support in new versions of Linux libc instead of libshadow.a,
  see HAVE_SHADOWPWD, HAVE_SHADOWGRP in config.h.linux (shadow.c, gshadow.c)
- "no shadow password" not logged, the same /bin/login should work with both
  shadow and non-shadow passwords (lmain.c)
- some cleanup in various places (lmain.c, passwd.c)
- new program to verify username/password pairs, for xlock etc.; it is not
  installed by default, read the comments first (pwdauth.c)
- authentication programs run with empty environment for safety (pwauth.c)
- added missing fstat error checks (faillog.c, lastlog.c, setup.c, *io.c)
- common code separated from *io.c (commonio.c)
- ownership and permissions on password files are now preserved (we may try
  to make more use of setgid and setuid non-root programs in the future)
- added (untested) MD5-based crypt() from FreeBSD (md5crypt.c), see
  MD5_CRYPT in config.h.linux and MD5_CRYPT_ENAB in login.defs.linux
- termios/termio/sgtty macros cleaned up a bit

shadow-951218 => shadow-960129

Emergency bug fix release - no new features since 951218.  There are many
new changes, but this bug really can't wait until they are tested.

Probably all previous versions of the shadow suite have a serious bug which
makes it possible to overwrite the stack by entering very long username at
the login prompt.  This can give root access to any remote user!

Changed the maximum size in login.c from BUFSIZ (1024) to 32 (to match
size of the array in lmain.c).  Aaargh!!!

shadow-951203 => shadow-951218

Changes:
- Linux utmp handling fixes (utmp.c)
- last failure date printing fixes (failure.c)
- minor fix to compile with USE_CRACKLIB (obscure.c)
- eliminated the use of snprintf (env.c, lmain.c, login.c, shell.c, smain.c)
- basename.c added, replacing duplicated code in various places
- "su -" runs the shell with '-' in argv[0] again (smain.c)
- removing at/cron jobs cleaned up (userdel.c)
- /etc/gshadow should not be world-readable (sgroupio.c)
- if fflush() failed, files were not closed (*io.c)
- login prompt is now "hostname login: " on Linux (lmain.c, login.c)
- "save" and "restore" targets commented out (don't work) (Makefile.linux)
- some minor cleanups for gcc -Wall (unused variables etc.)
- removed README.FIRST (copyrights are OK now)
- updated ANNOUNCE, README.linux, WISHLIST
- as suggested, converted to RCS

shadow-3.3.2-951127 => shadow-951203-jfh

Changes:
- Added the BSD-style copyright to all of the files.  Any files with the
  old copyright have multiple copyright holders and need to be cleanroomed
  to produce BSD-style copyrightable files, or I need to get the consent
  of the others to change the copyright.
- Changed the ANNOUNCE file to not refer to the README.FIRST file.  Now
  that all of the files should have the correct copyright there is no need
  to refer to that e-mail message.
- Changes SCCS strings to "%W% %U% %G%".  Marek needs to either convert to
  RCS or check into SCCS and then checkout.  I'd suggest using RCS ;-)

  jfh@rpp386.cactus.org

shadow-3.3.2-951106 => shadow-951127

Note: for now this code only supports Linux.  All the #ifdef's are there
(and will be; support for at least SunOS 4.1.x would be nice) but:
- I had to fix some potential security problems resulting from sloppy
  coding (no bounds checking), and it was easier for me to use snprintf()
  (not available on many systems, unfortunately), I'll fix that later.
  Old versions of Linux libc don't have snprintf() either, and the one
  in libbsd.a ignores the max size - don't use it!  (libc-4.6.27 is OK)
- I am lazy and only updated Makefile.linux and config.h.linux this time
- I don't have root access to non-Linux systems (this means no testing)
- this code needs some major reorganization, which will (hopefully)
  make porting easier

Changes:
- some code cleanup, prototypes.h, defines.h, Makefile and config.h changes
- login can be statically linked (not that I think it's a good idea, better
  fix the telnetd, but paranoid people will like it :-)
- login is installed non-setuid by default
- check for NULL from getpass()
- wipe cleartext password from getpass() when no longer needed (pwauth.c)
- use standard "Password: " prompt by default (pwauth.c)
- hopefully fixed bogus sigaction() stuff (Linux only) (getpass.c)
- oops, setrlimit wants bytes, ulimit wants 512-byte units (lmain.c)
- Linux has <lastlog.h>
- print ll_host on Linux too (lmain.c)
- size checking in various places (setuid root programs, argh!)
- preserve TERM from getty (lmain.c)
- don't ignore SIGHUP (lmain.c)
- :%s/setenv/set_env/g (setenv(3) conflict) (env.c, lmain.c, login.c)
- remove LD_xxx (env.c)
- use bzero() instead of memset() for BSD portability and less #ifdef's
  (if the system has no bzero(), implement it as a macro using memset())
- the above fixes wrong order of memset() parameters (log.c)
- use getutent/pututline instead of doing it by hand (utmp.c)
- added the new settings to login.defs.linux
- added login_access.c to the distribution (not used yet)

==========

shadow-3.3.2 => shadow-3.3.2-951106

- added dummy pad.c and #ifdef'ed out references to pad_auth (pwauth.c)
- malloc/strdup error checking, hopefully no more core dumps...
- define HAVE_RLIMIT instead of HAVE_ULIMIT for Linux (config.h.linux)

- larger buffer for cipher, for md5 crypt() if and when (encrypt.c, passwd.c)
- use POSIX termios whenever possible on Linux
- list.c, removed add_list/del_list from gpmain.c, user{add,del,mod}.c
- strtoday.c, removed duplicates from chage.c, useradd.c, usermod.c

- swapped chfn USAGE and ADMUSAGE (chfn.c)
- added -u to passwd usage (passwd.c)
- no #! check necessary for Linux (shell.c)
- define OLD_CRON for some old incompatible Linux distributions (userdel.c)
- PASS_MAX is now 127 (not 8) for Linux (getpass.c)
- LOGIN_RETRIES, LOGIN_TIMEOUT, PASS_CHANGE_TRIES are no longer compiled in,
  can now be set in login.defs, old values are used as defaults (lmain.c)
- unique uid/gid selection now more robust (useradd.c, groupadd.c)
- UID_MIN, UID_MAX, GID_MIN, GID_MAX in login.defs (useradd.c, groupadd.c)
- CRACKLIB_DICTPATH no longer compiled in, can be set in login.defs (passwd.c)
- PASS_ALWAYS_WARN: warn about weak passwords even for root (passwd.c)
- PASS_MAX_LEN, check truncated passwords again (obscure.c)
- check for weak passwords too if previous password was empty (obscure.c)
- CHFN_RESTRICT: don't let users change their full names (chfn.c)
- Linux has getusershell(), use it (chsh.c)
- check if the new shell is executable by the user (chsh.c)
- sleep before printing "Login incorrect", not the other way around (lmain.c)
- don't be picky about utmp only if any of -rfh flags given (lmain.c)
- do "wheel group" more like BSD does (smain.c)
- use getlogin() in su (smain.c)
- UMASK from login.defs defaults to 077, not 0 (lmain.c, newusers.c)
- #undef HAS_ATRM for Linux until atrm can do what we need (config.h.linux)
- Linux has most commands in /usr/bin, not /bin (age.c, passwd.c, userdel.c)
- ULIMIT from login.defs works on systems using setrlimit() too (lmain.c)
- LOGIN_STRING should work now (pwauth.c, getdef.c)
- kludge to avoid conflict with Linux <shadow.h> (gshadow.h)
- mv Makefile Makefile.xenix ; mv config.h config.h.xenix - so that they are
  not lost when you copy the right ones to Makefile and config.h
