.TH LASTLOG 8
.SH NAME
lastlog \- examine lastlog file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 8
\fBlastlog\fR [\fBoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlastlog\fR formats and prints the contents of the last login log
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR file. The \fBlogin\-name\fR, \fBport\fR, and \fBlast
login time\fR will be printed. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries
to be printed, sorted by their order in \fB/etc/passwd\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
The options which apply to the \fBlastlog\fR command are:
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR"
Print help message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR \fIDAYS\fR"
Print the lastlog records more recent than \fIDAYS\fR.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR \fILOGIN\fR"
Print the lastlog record for user with specified \fILOGIN\fR only.
.TP
The \fB\-t\fR flag overrides the use of \fB\-u\fR.
.PP
If the user has never logged in the message \fB"**Never logged in**"\fR will
be displayed instead of the port and time.
.SH FILES
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR	\- lastlog logging file
.SH CAVEATS
Large gaps in uid numbers will cause the lastlog program to run longer with
no output to the screen (i.e. if mmdf=800 and last uid=170, program will
appear to hang as it processes uid 171\-799).
