.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gpasswd
is used to administer the /etc/group file (and /etc/gshadow
file if compiled with SHADOWGRP defined). Every group can
have administrators, members and a password. System
administrator can use \fB-A\fR option to define group
administrator(s) and \fB-M\fR option to define members and
has all rights of group administrators and members.
.PP
Group administrator can add and delete users using \fB-a\fR
and \fB-d\fR options respectively. Administrators can use
\fB-r\fR option to remove group password. When no password 
is set only group members can use
.BR newgrp (1)
to join the group. Option \fB-R\fR disables 
access to the group through
.BR newgrp (1)
command.
.PP
\fBgpasswd\fR called by a group administrator with group name only prompts
for the group password. If password is set the members can still
.BR newgrp (1)
without a password, non-members must supply the password.
