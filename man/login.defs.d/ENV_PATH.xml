      If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when
      a regular user login. The value can be preceded by
      <replaceable>PATH=</replaceable>, or a colon separated list of paths
      (for example <replaceable>/bin:/usr/bin</replaceable>). The default
      value is <replaceable>PATH=/bin:/usr/bin</replaceable>.
