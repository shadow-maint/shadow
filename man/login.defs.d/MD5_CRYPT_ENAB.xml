  <term><option>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB</option> (boolean)</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
      algorithm. If set to <replaceable>yes</replaceable>, new passwords
      will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the
      one used by recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
      unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to
      <replaceable>no</replaceable> if you need to copy encrypted
      passwords to other systems which don't understand the new algorithm.
      Default is <replaceable>no</replaceable>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This variable is superceded by the <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option>
      variable or by any command line option used to configure the
      encryption algorithm.
    </para>
    <para>
      This variable is deprecated. You should use
      <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note: if you use PAM, it is recommended to set this variable
      consistently with the PAM modules configuration.
