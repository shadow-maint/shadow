  <listitem>
    <para>
      Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should be
      updated. As higher user IDs are usually tracked by remote user
      identity and authentication services there is no need to create
      a huge sparse lastlog file for them.
    </para>
    <para>
      No <option>LASTLOG_UID_MAX</option> option present in the configuration
      means that there is no user ID limit for writing lastlog entries.
