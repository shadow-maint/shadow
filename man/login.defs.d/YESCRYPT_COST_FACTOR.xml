    <para>
      When <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option> is set to
      <replaceable>YESCRYPT</replaceable>, this defines the cost factor
      used by the encryption algorithm by default (when the cost factor
      is not specified on the command line).
    </para>
    <para>
      With a high cost factor, it is more difficult to brute force the
      password. But note also that more CPU resources will be needed to
      authenticate users.
    </para>
    <para>
      The value must be inside the 1-11 range.
    </para>

      Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords.
      The generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the
      PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
      consistently with the PAM configuration.
