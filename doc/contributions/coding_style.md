# Coding style

* For a general guidance refer to the
[Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html)

* Patches that change the existing coding style are not welcome, as they make
downstream porting harder for the distributions

## Indentation

Tabs are preferred over spaces for indentation. Loading the `.editorconfig`
file in your preferred IDE may help you configure it.
