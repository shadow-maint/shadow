/*
 * SYNOPSIS
 *	[[gnu::malloc(erase_pass)]]
 *	char *agetpass(const char *prompt);
 *
 *	void erase_pass(char *pass);
 *
 * ARGUMENTS
 *   agetpass()
 *	prompt	String to be printed before reading a password.
 *
 *   erase_pass()
 *	pass	password previously returned by agetpass().
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   agetpass()
 *	This function is very similar to getpass(3).  It has several
 *	advantages compared to getpass(3):
 *
 *	- Instead of using a static buffer, agetpass() allocates memory
 *	  through malloc(3).  This makes the function thread-safe, and
 *	  also reduces the visibility of the buffer.
 *
 *	- agetpass() doesn't reallocate internally.  Some
 *	  implementations of getpass(3), such as glibc, do that, as a
 *	  consequence of calling getline(3).  That's a bug in glibc,
 *	  which allows leaking prefixes of passwords in freed memory.
 *
 *	- agetpass() doesn't overrun the output buffer.  If the input
 *	  password is too long, it simply fails.  Some implementations
 *	  of getpass(3), share the same bug that gets(3) has.
 *
 *	As soon as possible, the password obtained from agetpass() be
 *	erased by calling erase_pass(), to avoid possibly leaking the
 *	password.
 *
 *   erase_pass()
 *	This function first clears the password, by calling
 *	explicit_bzero(3) (or an equivalent call), and then frees the
 *	allocated memory by calling free(3).
 *
 *	NULL is a valid input pointer, and in such a case, this call is
 *	a no-op.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE
 *	agetpass() returns a newly allocated buffer containing the
 *	password on success.  On error, errno is set to indicate the
 *	error, and NULL is returned.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *   agetpass()
 *	This function may fail for any errors that malloc(3) or
 *	readpassphrase(3) may fail, and in addition it may fail for the
 *	following errors:
 *
 *	ENOBUFS
 *		The input password was longer than PASS_MAX.
 *
 * CAVEATS
 *	If a password is passed twice to erase_pass(), the behavior is
 *	undefined.
